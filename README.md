# Applied Data Science Capstone

Taking the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company Space Y, that would like to compete with SpaceX, I had to predict whether the first stage of Falcon 9 Rocket will land successfully.

The following data analysis procedures were used for this project:
1) Data Collection ( Using the SpaceX API and webcraping)
2) Data Wrangling
3) EDA with SQL and Data Visualization(MatplotLib)
4) Interactive Visual Analytics ( Data Visualization wiht folium and building a Dashboard with Ploty Dash)
5) Machine Learnig Prediction: 
   I used Decision Tree classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and KNN combined with GridSearchCV to find the optimal paramateres for every model.
